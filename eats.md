Stop taking chances with where you eat. When you stop outside a restaurant, Eats will send you a notification with either a thumbs up or a thumbs down…and if you need more information, just swipe for customer review, hours and more. Or open up the Eats app and get a list of the best restaurants near you.

Built for densely populated urban environments, Eats’ revolutionary notification-based interface means that you don’t have to ask your phone to help you out—everything is automatic. Only possible thanks to cutting-edge technology, Eats is your friend who knows what’s good, at every restaurant everywhere.

Available soon on the App Store.
