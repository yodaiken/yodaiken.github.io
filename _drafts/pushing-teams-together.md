The best thing about working with non-profits as a student is that you rarely have to beg people to work with you—come up with an idea that’s compelling, tell people about it and volunteers will come. At [<span>RealityStep</span>](http://www.realitystep.org/?ref=ay-pushing-teams-together), my co-founder and I were able to assemble a team of over fifty incredibly smart, talented and dedicated volunteers in a matter of weeks.

The worst thing about working with non-profits as a student is that every single volunteer you get is completely over-committed. Most of our volunteers are taking over twenty credits a semester. Many have internships in laboratories and Fortune-500s. A few are elected officials in student government. Some are working as leaders on projects of their own, from tech startups to music composition. Almost everyone in RealityStep is a member of at least one other student club or organization.

Even with the most dedicated team—and at RealityStep we’re lucky to have fantastically dedicated volunteers—it doesn’t take a genius to see that all of these other commitments means that student organizations are at a big disadvantage to “normal” non-profits that have dedicated office workers in one space from 9–5. **Because they don’t have regular hours and because they are constantly competing for their members’ time, highly distributed student teams lack both the drive and the focus of typical organizations.**

(Of course, this disadvantage doesn't just affect student non-profits—I’ve seen many for-profit student startups fail for similar reasons.)

At RealityStep, we’ve tried to use some online project management software designed for distributed teams to help solve part of the problem. [<span>Trello</span>](http://trello.com) in particular has been a tremendous help in staying up on what we need to do and who is doing it. Short, in-person weekly meetings with various teams and top leadership to review progress and set goals also make a big difference in keeping everyone honest about how much work is really getting done.

But technology and a few hours meetings can’t make up for 40-hours of office time. That’s why we tried something at RealityStep called the “push”:

## Meet the Push

The RealityStep Push was inspired by the Hackathon—organized events where programmers form teams to code prototypes of useful, working software in a 24-hour sprint, fueled by lots of take-out and caffeine. Here’s what we did:
