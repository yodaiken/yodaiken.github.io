The best thing about working with non-profits as a student is that you rarely have to beg people to work with you—come up with an idea that’s compelling, tell people about it and volunteers will come. At [<span>RealityStep</span>](http://www.realitystep.org/?ref=ay-pushing-teams-together), my co-founder and I were able to assemble a team of over fifty incredibly smart, talented and dedicated volunteers in a matter of weeks.

The worst thing about working with non-profits as a student is that every single volunteer you recruit—no mater how dedicated to your own organization—is completely over-committed. Most of our volunteers are taking over twenty credits a semester. Many have internships in laboratories and Fortune-500s. A few are elected officials in student government. Some are working as leaders on projects of their own, from tech startups to music composition. Almost everyone in RealityStep is a member of at least one other student club or organization.

It doesn’t take a genius to see that all of these other commitments means that student organizations are at a big disadvantage to “normal” non-profits that have dedicated office workers in one space from 9–5. There are two distinct problems that this creates:

1. **Focus**—what should volunteers be working on? In a typical small startup office, organization members are constantly communicating with each other in person, on whiteboards, through Instant Messaging about what needs to get done. In a typical student organization, every volunteer has a different schedule and works in a different place—which means these traditional approaches don’t work all that well.
2. **Efficiency**—how can work get done fast?

 **So highly distributed student organizations—because they don’t have regular hours, because they are constantly competing for their members’ time—lack both the focus and the efficiency of typical organizations.** (This disadvantage, of course, doesn't just affect non-profits—I’ve seen and been a part of many for-profit student startups that fail for similar reasons.)

At RealityStep, we’ve tried to use some online project management software designed for distributed teams to help solve part of the problem. [<span>Trello</span>](http://trello.com) in particular has been a tremendous help in staying up on what we need to do and who is doing it. Short, in-person weekly meetings with various teams and top leadership to review progress and set goals also make a big difference in keeping everyone honest about how much work is really getting done.

These mostly solved the “what should we be doing” problem. But they didn’t solve the

But technology and a few hours meetings can’t make up for 40-hours of office time. We found that our progress was much slower than it needed to be—after looking at a calendar, we saw that RealityStep might miss its launch deadline if we didn’t do something new.

And so, two weeks ago we had our first ever RealityStep “Push”:
