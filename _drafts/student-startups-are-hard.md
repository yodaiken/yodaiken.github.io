title: Student Startups are Hard

Sometime around the end of my freshman year at [<span>a fantastic high school in the middle of Texas</span>](http://whschaps.com/?ref=aaron-yodaiken), I found myself seriously trying—for the first time—to get a startup off the ground.

The idea was a twist on Facebook: instead of status updates, my new social network was going to have shared “events” and, in the same vein, instead of “friends”, you’d just have people who went to the same events as you. Simpler, easier, more organized. I asked my friends, and they agreed with me: this was the [<span>Next Big Thing</span>](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/next+big+thing).

And so, armed with the promise of three months of summer and the fruits of a year of AP Computer Science (which taught elementary OOP through Java), I set off with a couple buddies from class to create something that would change the world.

Not to spoil the story, but—we didn’t get too far. After spending about a month planning exactly how we’d split up our shares in the company, we did *start* coding. But then my one friend unexpectedly went on vacation to China with his family for rest the summer, my other friend realized that coding is a lot less fun than playing soccer, I got sidetracked trying to implement homegrown, 100%-accurate [<span>Natural Language Processing</span>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), and everyone else decided that the project was moving too slowly with no hope to succeed.

The idea, looking back, was actually a good one: this all happened a couple years before Facebook had a half-decent Events platform (which, actually, still isn’t that good!) and my fellow high school students seemed like they would, in fact, use it. The problem, of course, was one of execution.

It’s a tough problem—more tough, I’d argue, even than typical project management since your workers are (a) “working” for pure equity, (b) in no need of a job (supported by parents) and (c) blah blah.

I didn’t give up, though. Since then, I’ve more or less been working on one
